      notes:
        - .link([BTB Reference]https://youtu.be/Ki-nt715kZQ)
        - my visual cue on where to do the cryo block is right beside the bomb barrel; since the bokos dont crowd you as much and you can focus on this guy in particular.
        - slightly delayed shield jump, early bullet time, first frame bow unequip for maximum height, wait a second til you're over the water then unequip shield, and you should have enough height to get to this ore deposit for the BLSS
